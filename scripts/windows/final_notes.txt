# Notes on building the Windows port using Mingw, if you're not me, and
# not trying to develop or compile the Windows port and dependencies
# from source, you can safely ignore this file

Create Windows VM (with at least 4 cores, 8GB of memory, and 100GB of disk,
    because Windows is insanely bloated)

Name the user 'pydaw' (scripts have dependencies on home folder name)

Install Netbeans
  - Tools -> Plugins -> C/C++
  - Tools -> Options -> C/C++ -> Add C:\msys2\mingw64\bin
                     -> Editor -> On Save -> All Lang. -> Trim Whitespace

Install Anaconda (Spyder)
  - Tools -> Preferences (trim whitespace, change theme)

Install NSIS, Notepad++

Install MSYS2:
    * install to C:\msys64
    * a separate install at C:\{MAJOR_VERSION}
	without installing the dependencies below)

####From MSYS2 shell:

pacman -Sy  # Update package database
pacman -Su  # Update system, restart the terminal after

# Done on separate lines because there is a solid chance of any
# random pacman run failing.  Don't paste all lines in at once,
# the terminal gets confused.  Could possibly add the extra lines
# So that it simulates hitting enter twice for 'all' and 'Y' on the
# group installs

pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
pacman -S git
pacman -S python3
git clone https://github.com/stargateaudio/stargate.git

cd stargate/src
CC=/mingw64/bin/gcc /mingw64/bin/mingw32-make
make mingw
make PREFIX= DESTDIR=/mingw64 install_non_linux
