Description: 
        Pythonic libsndfile wrapper to read and write audio files.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Writer and reader objects are context managers
        - Format, channels, length, sample rate... are accessed as properties as well as text strings
        - Real multichannel (not just mono/stereo)
        - All libsndfile formats supported, floating point encodings by default
        - Numpy based interface
        - Generators for block by block reading
        - Reading reuses the same data block to avoid many data allocations
        - Shortened constant names for formats (Using scopes instead of prefixes)
        - Matlab-like whole-file interface (not recommended in production code but quite convenient for quick scripting)
        - Transparent UTF-8 handling for filenames and text strings
        - No module compilation required (wraps the dll using ctypes)
        - Works both for Python3 >= 3.2 and Python2 >= 2.6
