Version history
---------------

2009-05-08 Version 0.1

  * initial release

2009-05-16 Version 0.2

  * replace .debug section in executable rather than rename it. (only works
    if it is the last section).
  * support for field type LF_VFUNCTAB and symbol type S_CONSTANT used by DMC.
  * added stringview to autoexp.dat for full length text display.

2009-06-04 Version 0.3

  * static members' debug info was not correctly converted, causing debugger confusion
  * now works on executables compiled by DMC
    - added command line switch -C to disable some D feature and 
      to remove function name from local variables
    - added support for type LF_BITFIELD.
  * added fields __viewhelper to classes string and object
  * new addin dviewhelper.dll to display correctly terminated strings
    and derived object type

2009-06-05 Version 0.4

  * fixed crash when long is used as index or element type of dynamic or 
    associative arrays

2009-06-06 Version 0.5

  * fixed error in __viewhelper field of string type, that could screw up type info
  * added support for wstring and dstring
  * fixed problems with debug info inside library by combining debug info of different modules 
    into a single pseudo-module
  * now also replaces '.' by '@' in enumerator types for more consistent debug info

2009-06-07 Version 0.6

  * removed LF_DERIVED info from debug info, as it is inconsistent in DMD generated info
    with more than 4096 type entries

2009-06-08 Version 0.7

  * corrected number of field entries in classes or struct, because DMD miscounts private members

2009-06-11 Version 0.8

  * tweaked visualizer macros to detect uninitialized associative arrays and to limit expansion
    to arrays with less than 1024 entries
  * renamed data pointer member of dynamic arrays to "ptr" to be consistent with the array property
    in D.

2009-06-19 Version 0.9

  * fixed line number info at the end of a segment or when switching to another file 
    because of inline expansion
  * fixed line numbers > 32767 and sections with 0 line number entries

2009-08-12 Version 0.10

  * better support for DMC:
    - entries LF_FRIENDFCN removed
    - entries LF_FRIENDCLS, LF_VBCLASS and LF_IVBCLASS converted
    thanks to Andrew.
  * derived-classes info in class entry now cleared to be consistent with removal of LF_DERIVED

2009-12-29 Version 0.11

  * basic types now show with their D names, not as C types
  * "enum" prefix removed from type names of enumerator types
  * added type information for complex data types
  * dmd-patch needed for long/ulong support (http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3373)
  * experimental hack to add lexical scope to local variables (dmd patch in
    http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3657 needed)

2010-04-13 Version 0.12

  * added patch to convert binaries produced by Metroworks CodeWarrior
  * names of local function are now demangled
  * dmd 2.041 fixes long/ulong support (patch http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3373
    no longer needed)
  * added managed C++ project to integrate cv2pdb with CLR (thanks to Alexander Bothe)
  * dmd 2.043 uses different implementation of associative arrays, use command line
    option -D 2.043 or above to produce the respective debug info 

2010-06-03 Version 0.13

  * adapted to mspdb100.dll which comes with VS2010
  * tweaked autoexp.dat modifications to be more stable with uninitialized data
  * autoexp.snippet now split into two files: autoexp.expand and autoexp.visualizer

2010-06-23 Version 0.14

  * 64-integer types are now displayed as "dlong" and "ulong" instead of "__int64" and
    "unsigned __int64"
  * improved support for long and ulong for DMD versions before 1.057 and 2.041
  * DMC also emits D-types for "long long" and "unsigned long long", these are
    translated back to the correct types if command option -C is used
  * now adding properties "has nested type" and "is nested type" to class/struct/union/enum types
  * better support for enumerators: now added as user defined types (DMD patch needed)

2010-08-08 Version 0.15

  * thanks to patches by Z3N, the resulting pdb is now usable by more debuggers 
  * now uses shared file access to executable
  * incomplete structs/classes are now added as user defined types to avoid confusing
    debugger for following symbols
  * fixed name demangling of very long names
  * added name demangling support for @safe/@trusted/@property/pure/nothrow/ref
  * base classes are added to D/cpp-interfaces to allow viewing the virtual function 
    table pointer
  * structs, classes and interfaces now have an internal qualifier attached that allows
    the preview in autoexp.dat to show better info for structs and interfaces

    information for recent compilers by default

2010-12-30 Version 0.20

  * fixed another issue with user defined type names longer than 300 characters
